            "From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n"
            "Artificial intelligence (AI) is the intelligence of machines or software, as opposed to the intelligence of humans or animals. "
            "It is a field of study in computer science that develops and studies intelligent machines. Such machines may be called AIs.\n"
            "AI technology is widely used throughout industry, government, and science. Some high-profile applications include advanced web search engines; "
            "recommendation systems; understanding human speech; self-driving cars; generative and creative tools; and superhuman play and analysis in strategy games.\n"
            "\n"
            "History\n"
            "The study of artificial intelligence began in the 1940s and 1950s with the work of Alan Turing, who proposed the Turing Test as a measure of machine intelligence. "
            "The term \"artificial intelligence\" was coined by John McCarthy in 1956 at the Dartmouth Conference, which is considered the founding event of AI as a field.\n"
            "In the early days, researchers were optimistic about creating general AI within a generation. However, progress was slower than expected, leading to periods of "
            "reduced funding known as \"AI winters\" in the 1970s and 1990s.\n"
            "\n"
            "Machine Learning\n"
            "Machine learning is a subset of AI that enables systems to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. "
            "Machine learning algorithms build mathematical models based on training data to make predictions or decisions. "
            "Key approaches include supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning.\n"
            "Deep learning is a specialized form of machine learning that uses neural networks with multiple layers (hence \"deep\") to process complex patterns in data. "
            "Deep learning has been particularly successful in image recognition, natural language processing, and game playing.\n"
            "\n"
            "Neural Networks\n"
            "Artificial neural networks are computing systems inspired by the biological neural networks in animal brains. "
            "A neural network consists of layers of interconnected nodes (neurons), each of which performs a simple computation. "
            "The network learns by adjusting the weights of connections between neurons based on training data.\n"
            "Modern neural networks can have millions or billions of parameters and are trained on massive datasets using powerful hardware like GPUs.\n"
            "\n"
            "Applications\n"
            "AI has applications in numerous fields including healthcare, finance, transportation, education, and entertainment. "
            "In healthcare, AI is used for disease diagnosis, drug discovery, and personalized treatment plans. "
            "In finance, AI powers algorithmic trading, fraud detection, and risk assessment. "
            "In transportation, self-driving cars use AI to perceive their environment and make driving decisions.\n"
            "\n"
            "Ethics and Risks\n"
            "The development of AI raises ethical concerns including bias in AI systems, privacy issues, job displacement, and the potential for AI to be used maliciously. "
            "Researchers and policymakers are working on frameworks for responsible AI development, including fairness, transparency, and accountability.\n"
            "The long-term risk of artificial general intelligence (AGI) surpassing human intelligence is also a topic of serious discussion among researchers.\n"

            "\n"
            "Researchers at a leading AI laboratory have announced a significant breakthrough in artificial intelligence, "
            "with a new model demonstrating human-level reasoning capabilities on a range of complex cognitive tasks.\n"
            "\n"
            "The model, known as ReasonNet-X, was developed over three years by a team of 50 researchers. "
            "It achieved scores matching or exceeding human performance on benchmarks including logical reasoning, "
            "mathematical problem-solving, and scientific analysis.\n"
            "\n"
            "\"This is a milestone moment for the field of AI,\" said Dr. Sarah Chen, the project's lead researcher. "
            "\"For the first time, we have a system that can reason about complex problems in a way that is genuinely "
            "comparable to human thinking, not just pattern matching.\"\n"
            "\n"
            "The breakthrough builds on recent advances in large language models and reinforcement learning. "
            "The key innovation is a new architecture called Recursive Reasoning Networks, which allows the model "
            "to break down complex problems into smaller steps and reason about each step individually.\n"
            "\n"
            "However, some experts have urged caution. Professor Michael Roberts of Cambridge University said: "
            "\"While these results are impressive, we need to be careful about claiming human-level intelligence. "
            "Reasoning in controlled benchmarks is very different from reasoning in the messy real world.\"\n"
            "\n"
            "The researchers say the model will be open-sourced next month, allowing other scientists to verify "
            "the results and build upon the technology. They emphasize that the system is designed to assist humans, "
            "not replace them.\n"
            "\n"
            "Potential applications include scientific research, medical diagnosis, legal analysis, and education. "
            "The team is already working with hospitals to test the system's ability to assist doctors in diagnosing "
            "rare diseases.\n"
            "\n"
            "The announcement has sparked both excitement and concern in the AI community. While many see it as a "
            "major step forward, others worry about the implications of increasingly capable AI systems.\n"
            "\n"
            "\"We need to have serious conversations about how this technology is used,\" said Dr. Chen. "
            "\"AI this powerful comes with significant responsibility. We are committed to developing it safely and ethically.\"\n"

            "A function is a reusable set of statements that performs a task or calculates a value.\n"
            "\n"
            "Function declarations\n"
            "A function declaration (also called a function statement) consists of the function keyword, "
            "followed by the function name, a list of parameters, and the function body.\n"
            "Example: function square(number) { return number * number; }\n"
            "The function square takes one parameter, called number. The function consists of one statement "
            "that says to return the parameter of the function multiplied by itself.\n"
            "\n"
            "Function expressions\n"
            "A function expression is a function that is assigned to a variable. "
            "Example: const square = function(number) { return number * number; }\n"
            "Function expressions can be anonymous, meaning they don't have to have a name.\n"
            "\n"
            "Arrow functions\n"
            "Arrow functions provide a shorter syntax for writing function expressions. "
            "Example: const square = (number) => number * number;\n"
            "Arrow functions are always anonymous and do not have their own this, arguments, super, or new.target.\n"
            "\n"
            "Parameters\n"
            "Parameters are variables listed as part of the function definition. "
            "Arguments are values passed to the function when it is invoked. "
            "JavaScript functions can accept any number of arguments, regardless of the number of parameters declared.\n"
            "Default parameters allow you to specify default values for parameters.\n"
            "Example: function greet(name = 'World') { return 'Hello, ' + name; }\n"
            "\n"
            "Rest parameters\n"
            "The rest parameter syntax allows us to represent an indefinite number of arguments as an array. "
            "Example: function sum(...numbers) { return numbers.reduce((a, b) => a + b, 0); }\n"
            "\n"
            "Closures\n"
            "Closures are functions that refer to independent (free) variables. In other words, the function "
            "defined in the closure remembers the environment in which it was created. "
            "Example: function makeAdder(x) { return function(y) { return x + y; }; }\n"
            "Closures are useful for creating private variables and functions.\n"
            "\n"
            "Using objects\n"
            "Functions can work with objects as parameters. JavaScript passes objects by reference, "
            "so changes to the object inside the function affect the original object.\n"
            "\n"
            "Function scope\n"
            "Variables defined inside a function cannot be accessed from outside the function. "
            "This is called function scope. Variables declared with var are function-scoped, "
            "while variables declared with let and const are block-scoped.\n"
            "\n"
            "Recursion\n"
            "A function that calls itself is called recursive. Recursion is useful for tasks that can be "
            "broken down into smaller, similar subtasks.\n"
            "Example: function factorial(n) { if (n <= 1) return 1; return n * factorial(n - 1); }\n"
            "\n"
